# myscreenrecorder
<h1>Context</h1>
Under Windows, I could not (or did) find simple free software to make screenshots and
audio as video. Very useful for tutorials for example.
There are some free but the recording time is limited or there is a watermark inserted at the
beginning and end of the recording. Others generate uncompressed (very large) avi files with a size
limit of 2 GB.
Under Linux, I know at least 2:
- RecordMyDesktop => http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/downloads.php
- SimpleScreenRecorder => https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/
Although my software can run under Linux, I will focus instead on its use on Windows. I
provide all the operating modes and scripts to make it work also under Linux, without details.

This is the current application which is a <b>ffmpeg graphic front end </b>for recording the screen
and possibly audio through a microphone or through the speakers used (headphones or pc specific).
In addition to the software already mentioned, I also use a library (provided with the github
package) interface JNI JnativeHook available here =>
