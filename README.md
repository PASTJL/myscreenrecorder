# myscreenrecorder
<h1>Context</h1>
Under Windows, I could not (or did) find simple free software to make screenshots and
audio as video. Very useful for tutorials for example.</br>
There are some free but the recording time is limited or there is a watermark inserted at the
beginning and end of the recording.</br> Others generate uncompressed (very large) avi files with a size
limit of 2 GB.</br>
Under Linux, I know at least 2:</br>
- RecordMyDesktop =&gt; http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/downloads.php </br>
- SimpleScreenRecorder =&gt; https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/</br>
Although my software can run under Linux, I will focus instead on its use on Windows. I
provide all the operating modes and scripts to make it work also under Linux, without details.

<h1><b>myscreenrecorder</B></h1>
This application is just a <b>ffmpeg graphic front end </b>for recording the screen
and possibly audio through a microphone or through the speakers used (headphones or pc specific).</br>
ffmpeg is behind the scene, no need to knowit.</br>
In addition to the software already mentioned, I also use a library (provided with the github
package) interface JNI JnativeHook available here =>
