<H1>Context</H1>
<P>Under Windows, I could not (or did) find simple free software to
make screenshots and audio as video. Very useful for tutorials for
example.<BR>There are some free but the recording time is limited or
there is a watermark inserted at the beginning and end of the
recording.<BR>Others generate uncompressed (very large) avi files
with a size limit of 2 GB.<BR>Under Linux, I know at least 2:<BR>-
RecordMyDesktop =&gt;

SimpleScreenRecorder =&gt;
https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/<BR>Although my
software can run under Linux, I will focus instead on its use on
Windows. I provide all the operating modes and scripts to make it
work also under Linux, without details.

recording the screen and possibly audio through a microphone or
through the speakers used (headphones or pc specific).<BR><BR><B>ffmpeg
